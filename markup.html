<p>
<strong>I see your silhouette, </strong> <br>
An artist in a museum, <br>
Hundreds of creatives surround, <br>
But my eyes still land on you <br>
</p>
<p>
Paint my back like a canvass, <br>
Soften my heart like paint in water, <br>
For for every stroke, <br>
I an filled with color <br>
</p>
<p>
<strong> I see your silhouette, </strong> <br>
A writer in his comfort, <br>
Hundreds of papers surround, <br>
But you chose this one poem <br>
</p>
<p>
Write over me your secrets, <br>
Your wishes and unpleasant memories, <br>
And though I'll bleed in red ink, <br>
</p>
<p>
<em>I'll love you even so </em>
</p>
